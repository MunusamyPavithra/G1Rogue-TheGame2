### Overview: 
(As a part of our course work)
 Rogue1 is a 1980’s dungeon-crawling video game. It uses ASCII text to display a randomly
 generated set of dungeon floors that the player must navigate in order to retrieve the Amulet of
 Yendor, which is located on the dungeon’s deepest level. As the player moves through the
 dungeon floors, they will encounter monsters, and traps, and acquire magical items to help them on
 their quest. The player’s goal is to make it to the bottom floor of the dungeon, acquire the
 Amulet, and return to the surface without dying. If a player dies, they do not restart the game
 where they left off but must start over
